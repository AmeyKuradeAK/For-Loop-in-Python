# In this repo We are learning how to use For Loop in Python

It's simple as 'for _ in _'

# Example

With the "for" loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, string etc.\
For eg -
> color = ["Red","Blue","Green","Black"]\
>            for x in color:\
>              print(x)\
>   output - Red\
>            Blue\
>            Green\
>            Black\

# Writing a program which does the following:
* Make a list called fruit "Apple","Grape", "Melon", "Kiwi", "Banana"
* Use a "for" loop to go through all the items in the above list and output them to the console one by one.
